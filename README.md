Chef-Licious was created as a recipe sharing social media platform for food enthusiasts worldwide. Many APIs limit data, as well as limit adding your own data! We wanted to make a recipe site with cuisine and tips accessible to the everyday cook, anywhere in the world to extend a sense of community and conversation to the technical side of cooking by allowing users to discuss and share their favorite recipes and tips. 

Technology Used: 
Bulma CSS Framework
Sequelize
Handlebars
Passport.js
Amazon s3
MySQL
Express

There are improvements needed. An actual fully functional web application would be awesome!
*Full Functionality and Responsiveness
*Interactive User Profiles
*Calories within Recipe Database from querying USDA API
*External UPC Scanner to find recipes containing a certain item
*Save Recipes
*Meal Planning Functionality
